Student Placement Prediction App

This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts whether a student is likely to be placed based on their CGPA and IQ. 
It uses a trained Logistic Regression model, serialized with 'joblib', and deployed through a simple HTML form interface.

->Features

* Input: CGPA and IQ score
* Output: Prediction indicating placement likelihood
* Trained using multiple ML models for benchmarking (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree)
* Final model: Logistic Regression (`final_model.pkl')
* Frontend served with Flask and rendered via 'index.html'

-> Model Training ('SPP.py')

* Dataset: 'placement-dataset.csv`
* Preprocessing:
  * Dropped index column
  * Used CGPA and IQ as input features
* Models Evaluated:

  * Logistic Regression ✅ (final model)
  * Random Forest
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Decision Tree
* Model Persistence: Trained logistic regression model saved as 'final_model.pkl'

->Web Application ('app.py')

* Flask-based app with:

  * '/' route: Renders input form
  * '/predict' route: Accepts POST request, loads model, and predicts based on input

Example Prediction Flow:

1. User submits CGPA and IQ
2. Model returns:

   * ✅ Likely to be placed!
   * ❌ May not be placed.
->Setup Instructions

1.Prerequisites:
* Python 3.8+
* Flask
* NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Joblib

2.Installation:
pip install flask numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib joblib

3.Running the App:
python app.py

App will be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
-Sample Input:
CGPA: 8.2
IQ: 110
-Output:
✅ Likely to be placed!


->Notes

* Ensure 'final_model.pkl' is in the same directory as 'app.py'.
* Add an 'index.html' file inside the `templates/` folder with input fields for CGPA and IQ and a prediction display area.
